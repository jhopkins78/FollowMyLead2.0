Project Overview
FollowMyLead is a web-based application that leverages Machine Learning (ML) to optimize lead management and improve sales conversion rates. Designed to cater to businesses of all sizes, the tool provides actionable insights through predictive modeling, data visualization, and interactive dashboards. The project demonstrates expertise in data engineering, ML model development, and full-stack web development, integrating both front-end and back-end technologies to deliver a seamless user experience.

Key Features

Predictive Lead Scoring Model
Uses supervised learning (Random Forest model) to assign a probability score to each lead, indicating its likelihood of conversion.
Incorporates data preprocessing techniques like One-Hot Encoding for categorical data and SMOTE to handle class imbalance.
Interactive Dashboards
Visualizes lead metrics using graphs, heatmaps, and bar charts for feature importance.
Empowers users with insights into sales performance, lead quality, and conversion trends.
Dynamic Insights
Generates insights through tailored recommendations for lead prioritization and resource allocation.
Includes a feature importance chart to highlight critical drivers of lead conversion.
Scalable and Secure Deployment
Hosted using AWS Elastic Beanstalk for dynamic scalability and robust infrastructure management.
S3 storage is used to manage application data and logs.
Responsive Front-End
Developed using React.js, ensuring an intuitive and responsive UI/UX for end users.
Real-time updates and a clean interface make the application accessible and engaging.
Back-End and API Integration
Node.js handles server-side logic and API endpoints for model interaction.
Includes integration with RESTful APIs for smooth communication between the front-end and back-end.
Cloud-First Architecture
The application is fully integrated with AWS services (Elastic Beanstalk, S3, EC2, and IAM roles) for deployment and monitoring.
Designed to scale dynamically based on user demand.
Development Workflow

Data Preparation
Cleaned and preprocessed a complex dataset, separating categorical and numerical features.
Applied imputation techniques to handle missing values and ensured all features were properly formatted for ML.
Model Development
Built and optimized a Random Forest model using feature selection, hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV), and performance evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score).
Deployed the model through a robust pipeline for seamless integration with the application.
Front-End Development
Developed a modern UI using React.js with interactive elements to visualize predictions and actionable insights.
Incorporated graphing libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to enhance the visualization experience.
Back-End Integration
Implemented a Node.js back-end to connect the UI with the ML model and handle user requests.
Developed API endpoints for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.
Cloud Deployment
Configured AWS Elastic Beanstalk for the application deployment, ensuring reliability and ease of updates.
Set up launch templates, security groups, and IAM roles for proper access and permissions.
Testing and Optimization
Conducted extensive testing to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of predictions.
Performed scalability tests to validate the application’s cloud infrastructure under varying loads.
